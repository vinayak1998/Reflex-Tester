# Reflex-Tester

This project aims to test how fast you can respond after seeing a visual stimulus or rather
hand-eye coordination. There would be a “reset” button to reset all the states and make the
system ready for the next reflex test. It will then display a “hi” message on 7-segment display to
show that it is ready for next input. The user needs to press the “start” button to start a random
number generator that turns on the “output led” after a random interval. (Randomness is
important here, otherwise the time of led on can be memorized). After the led is on, the timer
starts and counts the time till the user presses “stop” button. At this time, the reaction time
should be displayed on the 7-segment display and hi message should be removed from
7-segment display.
